/* 
 	Given a matrix, check whether it’s Magic Square or not. A Magic Square is a n x n matrix of the distinct elements from 1 to n*n where the sum of any row, column, or diagonal is always equal to the same number.
Points:-
Find the sum of prime diagonal and secondary diagonal. 
Calculate the sum of each row and column. 
If the prime diagonal and secondary diagonal sums are equal to every row’s sum and every column’s sum, then it is the magic matrix.

For example:-
Input : n = 3
  2   7   6
  9   5   1
  4   3   8 
Output : Magic matrix
Explanation:In matrix sum of each
row and each column and diagonals sum is 
same = 15.
Test case :-
Input : n = 3
  1   2   2 
  2   2   1
  2   1   2
Output : Not a Magic Matrix
Explanation:In matrix sum of each
row and each column and diagonals sum is
not same.
